Abstract

Recommender systems were created to represent user preferences
for the purpose of suggesting items to purchase or
examine. However, there are several optimizations to be
made in these systems mainly with respect to modeling the
user profile and remove the noise information. This paper
proposes a collaborative filtering approach based on preferences
of groups of users to improve the accuracy of recommendation,
where the distance among users is computed using
multiple types of users’ feedback. The advantage of this
approach is that relevant items will be suggested based only
on the subjects of interest of each group of users. Using this
technique, we use a state-of-art collaborative filtering algorithm
to generate a personalized ranking of items according
to the preferences of an individual within each cluster. The
experimental results show that the proposed technique has
a higher precision than the traditional models without clustering.
